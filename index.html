        <h1><u>History of Javascript</u></h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997. <br> ECMAScript is the official name of the language. <br> ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6. <br> Since 2016, versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020).
    </p>
    <h1><u>ES1</u></h1>
    <P>ES1, also known as ECMAScript 1, was the first standardized version of JavaScript. <br> It introduced fundamental features that laid the foundation for the language, <br> including: Variables (): ES1 introduced the keyword for variable declaration, <br> And making it possible to store and manipulate data within scripts.</P>
    <h1><u>ES2</u></h1>
    <p>ES2 was introduced in 1998  <br>And there was a minor update that focused on improving the existing features and clarifying the language's specification. <br> No major new features were introduced in this version.</p>
    <h1><u>ES3</u></h1>
    <p>ES3 waas introduced in 1999 <br> ES3 was a significant milestone in JavaScript's history, <br>solidifying its place as the language of the web. <br> Notable features added in ES3 included: Try-Catch: ES3 introduced structured error handling with the , , and statements.</p>
    <h1><u>ES4</u></h1>
    <P>The first draft of ECMAScript 4 was dated February 1999, <br> and over time many features were proposed, including classes, interfaces, and optional type annotations. <br> ES4 was beginning to look more like our modern-day version of TypeScript.</P>
    <h1><u>ES5</u></h1>
    <P>ES5 was officially released in December of 2009, and was known as a great “compromise.” <br> The 10 years of disagreement over ES4 was behind them, and this new version added several enhancements to the standard library. <br> ES5 became one of the most supported versions of JavaScript.</P>
    <h1><u>ES6</u></h1>
    <P>To address the limitations of the early versions of JavaScript, <br>the language was updated in 2015 with the release of ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ES2015. <br> ES6 introduced a number of new features, including arrow functions, block-scoped variables, classes, and template literals.</P>
